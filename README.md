# DCDC

Dream Camp Data Capture tool. Lets you collect information about student participation at DC. 

## Vision

This tool is the front end of a survey creation mechanism - think Google Forms. It eventually will be able to collect any kind of data on Volunteers, Students, Shelters, Events, etc. Right now its being done thru Google Forms, Sheets or Formad. Eventually, when this app matures, this will replace all of them.
